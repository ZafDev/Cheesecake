        <h4>The Perfect Cheesecake Recipe</h4>
        <p><h4>This cheesecake recipe has been a long time coming.</h4></p>
        <p>For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt),
            it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I’ve shared a few 
            cheesecake variations in the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected 
            classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.</p>
        <p>Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I’ve always found them to be largely unnecessary with
             cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and follow my tips below and you’ll have a 
             perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.</p>    
        <h2>Igredients:</h2>
        <h3>Gracham Cracker Crust</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>170g cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon brown sugar (can substitute white)</li>
                <li>7 Tablespoons butter melted</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>32 oz cream cheese² softened to room temperature (910g)</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar 200g</li>
                <li>⅔ cups sour cream 160g</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>4 large eggs room temperature, lightly beaten</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 160C.</li>
                <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker
                    crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter 
                    and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
                <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom 
                    and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>    
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add 
                    cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll 
                    incorporate too much air).</li>
                <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>  
                <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. 
                    If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides 
                    and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
                <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, 
                    stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, 
                    use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all 
                    ingredients are well combined.</li>
                <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place
                    pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 160C for about 75 minutes. 
                    Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden 
                    brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. 
                    Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes 
                    has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan 
                    (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
                <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring
                    to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
